/*
 * This OpMode illustrates the concept of driving a path based on encoder counts.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * The code REQUIRES that you DO have encoders on the wheels,
 *   otherwise you would use: RobotAutoDriveByTime;
 *
 *  This code ALSO requires that the drive Motors have been configured such that a positive
 *  power command moves them forward, and causes the encoders to count UP.
 *
 *   The desired path in this example is:
 *   - Drive forward for 48 inches
 *   - Spin right for 12 Inches
 *   - Drive Backward for 24 inches
 *   - Stop and close the claw.
 *
 *  The code is written using a method called: encoderDrive(speed, leftInches, rightInches, timeoutS)
 *  that performs the actual movement.
 *  This method assumes that each movement is relative to the last stopping place.
 *  There are other ways to perform encoder based moves, but this method is probably the simplest.
 *  This code uses the RUN_TO_POSITION mode to enable the Motor controllers to generate the run profile
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list
